# 🤖 MLAModelHub

**MLAModelHub** is a personal project and codebase for **fully reproducible machine learning experiments**. This repository is built around a **single, streamlined script** that does it all:

✅ Trains a model  
✅ Evaluates performance  
✅ Saves results & model weights  
✅ Logs the full configuration  
✅ Captures the code and environment state  

All in one go — so you never lose track of **what was run**, **how it was run**, or **what it produced**.

## 🚀 What This Project Is

A plug-and-play skeleton for machine learning workflows that guarantees:

- 📦 **One-command reproducibility**
- 🔁 Re-runnable experiments using saved configs
- 📁 Versioned model + config + metrics artifacts
- 🔒 Code snapshotting for experiment integrity
- 🧪 Extensible to any dataset or model

---

## 🧰 Features

- 🧠 **Single entry-point script** for training + evaluation + logging
- 🗂️ **Automatic saving** of:
  - Model checkpoints (`.pt` or `.pkl`)
  - Config file used for the run
  - Evaluation metrics (accuracy, loss, etc.)
  - Environment information (e.g., `requirements.txt`, Python version)
- 🔁 **Re-run exact experiment** from a single config
- 💬 Simple and human-readable configs in YAML or JSON
- 🧱 Minimal dependencies and highly customizable structure
